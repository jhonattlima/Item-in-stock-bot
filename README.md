# Item-in-stock-bot
I created these scripts because I wat trying to buy a new video card. This small script can be used to search for specific buttons in a page (like #add to cart") or if page does not contains a specific sentence anymore (like "out of stock"). When the item gets available, the script sends you an alert mail (you have to configure it before).I hope it helps you.
